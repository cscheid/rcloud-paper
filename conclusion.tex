\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We presented a case for an environment that supports the visual
analytics process, from data acquisition and exploratory
data analysis, through development and deployment.
This approach can be considered ``DevOps for data science''
or reproducible data science.
The environment supports collaboration and communication
with capabilities for creating and sharing experimental workbooks,
version control, searching, recommending, annotating, and publishing
experiments as web sites and as reusable services. 

We implemented these ideas in the RCloud prototype.
Experience with the prototype provides evidence that data
science teams and the organizations in which they work
benefit from having such capabilities.

Some possible next steps are to support cross-language development,
to incorporate richer recommendation techniques, to provide fine-grained
information security, and to improve the usability of the human interface.
