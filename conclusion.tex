\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We presented a case for introducing web technologies
for searching, collaborating, recommending, publishing
reusable notebooks to the visual analytics process.
We implemented these ideas in the RCloud prototype.
RCloud assists software development and release using
an approach similar to DevOps in web services.
Experience with the prototype provided evidence that
data science teams, and the organizations in which they work,
benefit from having such capabilities.

Reasonable next steps are to support cross-language development,
source code analysis, richer recommendation techniques, and
improvements to the HTML5 human interface.
