\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We described the motivation for RCloud, a prototype
visual analytics environment that supports collaboration,
searching, sharing, and publishing of experiments.
This assists software development and release using
practices similar to DevOps in web services.
Experience with the Rcloud prototype provided evidence that
data science teams and the organizations in which they work
benefit from having such capabilities.

Future work will address cross-language development,
source code analysis, richer recommendation techniques,
and improvements to the HTML5 front end.
