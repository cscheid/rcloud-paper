\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We presented the ideas that motivated the design of RCloud,
a prototype visual analytics environment to support
collaboration, searching, sharing, and publishing of
experiments, similar to DevOps development of web services.
Experience with the prototype provided evidence that
data science teams and the organizations in which they work
can benefit from having such features.

Future work will address cross-language development,
source code analysis, richer recommendation techniques,
and improvements to the HTML5 front end.
