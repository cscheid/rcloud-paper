\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We presented a case for a data analytics environment that
supports the visual analytics process for work by teams.
This inclides data acquisition, exploratory data analysis,
code development and deployment.

Building on previous work that defines requirements for
visual analytics, we designed a prototype environment, RCloud.
RCloud supports collaboration and communication
through shared experimental workbooks with version
control, searching, recommending, annotating, and publishing
experiments as web sites and as reusable services. 

We deployed RCloud in a community of working data scientists.
Experience with the RCloud prototype provides evidence that data
science teams and the organizations in which they work benefit from
having capabilities that support collaboration and integrate
the entire visual analytics process.

Rcloud is a step toward practical ``DevOps for data science'' and
reproducible, publishable experiments.

Possible next steps are to support cross-language development,
to incorporate richer recommendation techniques, to provide fine-grained
information security, and to improve the usability of the human interface.
