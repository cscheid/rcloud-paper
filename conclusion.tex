\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We presented a case for environments that support the visual
analytics process, from data acquisition and exploratory
data analysis, through development and deployment.
The environment supports collaboration and communication
through shared experimental workbooks with version control,
searching, recommending, annotating, and publishing
experiments as web sites and as reusable services. 

Building from the extensive previous literature identifying
requirements for future visual analytics systems, our goal was
to gain experience and further insight by implementing and
deploying a prototype with a community of working data scientists.
Experience with the RCloud prototype provides evidence that data
science teams and the organizations in which they work
benefit from having such capabilities that support a
broad view of the visual analytics process.

Rcloud proposes a step toward practical ``DevOps for data
science'' with reproducible experiments.
Possible next steps are to support cross-language development,
to incorporate richer recommendation techniques, to provide fine-grained
information security, and to improve the usability of the human interface.
