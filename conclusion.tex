\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We presented a case for an environment that supports the entire
visual analytics work process, from data acquisition and exploratory
data analysis through development and production deployment. One might
think of this approach as ``DevOps for data science.'' The environment
supports collaboration and communication with capabilities for
creating and sharing experimental workbooks, version control,
searching, recommending, annotating, and deploying experiments
as web sites and as reusable services.

We implemented these ideas in the RCloud prototype.
Experience with the prototype provides evidence that data
science teams, and the organizations in which they work,
benefit from having such capabilities.

Next steps are to support cross-language development, to incorporate
richer source code analysis and recommendation techniques, and
to make improvements in the HTML5 human interface.
