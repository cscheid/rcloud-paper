Summary Review
The following presentation issues could be addressed in several weeks:
1- the beginning of the paper: on the issue, its important, and current
gap
2- system: provide more details about the system and some design
decisions
3- Evaluation: choice of evaluation, and more details about the
evaluation, settings, etc (right now it is too scattered and not
presented in a normal (or clear) format:  objectives, users, setting,
process,results, etc.
4-discussion: focus around the most important lesson learned.
