\section{Lessons Learned, Discussion and Limitations}

What are the decisions and ideas that are central to this paper?

discussion about binding times, running vs.caching.
transparent vs. explicit operations done by programmers

% limitations
Previous studies have pointed out difficulties in achieving the flexibility,
scalability and maintainability expected of production software with experimental
code created by data analysts.
Although these properties cannot be enforced by any programming environment,
suitable tools can help well-motivated analysts and programmers to create
robust applications with much less effort.

Asynchronous collaborative visual analytics
(ACVA)~\cite{Chen:2011:SEC}. This paper addresses visualization
\emph{of} the ACVA process. It will be important when we talk about
recommendation systems, and navigation of the set of notebooks, etc.
