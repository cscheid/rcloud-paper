%% Abstract section.
\abstract{ Consider the emerging role of a data science team within an
  organization. Individual data scientists and statisticians usually
  work on loosely related problems, and must devise effective ways to 
  share their findings and to move results from exploratory data analysis
  to automated diagnostics and reports deployed for wider consumption.
  There are two problems with the current
  practice. First, there are gaps in this workflow: EDA is performed
  with one set of tools, and automated reports and deployments with another.
  Second, EDA environments often assume a single-developer perspective,
  while data scientist teams could greatly benefit from easier sharing of
  scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations, and automated
  recommendations, which are well beyond what traditional version control
  systems provide.  In this paper, we propose RCloud, a system that supports
  collaborative data analysis, visualization and web deployment. We will
  discuss the design decisions, tradeoffs and limitations, and compare RCloud
  to other current proposals.

\section{Related Work}

Kandel et al. argue in their review of data wrangling work that data
cleaning, wrangling and transformation is a major part of exploratory
analysis and visualization~\cite{Kandel:2011:RDI}. Although RCloud
does not by itself include modules specific to data cleaning and
wrangling, we note from internal experience that these cleaning
scripts themselves tend to change over time. RCloud addresses this
issue by providing easy publishing of data-cleaning notebooks as web
services, which reduces the total data-cleaning effort across an
organization.

Kandel et al.'s interview study points out the typical ``explore'',
``model'', ``report'' cycle in enterprise data
analysis~\cite{Kandel:2012:EDA}. There are many discontinuities in
this cycle that cost time and effort to overcome.  RCloud seeks to
reduce this impedance mismatch. They also point out that larger teams
are becoming more common in data analysis, that supporting
collaboration is a difficult and important problem, and that sharing
and versioning of data sources and artifacts is hindered by current
technology in practice. ``We found that analysts typically did not
share scripts with each other. Scripts that were shared were
disseminated similarly to intermediate data: either through shared
drives or email. Analysts rarely stored their analytic code in source
control.'' Their work points to the opportunity for better technology
to support collaboration and sharing by data analysis teams.

Heer and Agarwala identify many design considerations for
collaborative visual analytics~\cite{Heer:2008:DCF}. \emph{Starring},
the system for signaling interest in notebooks, described in
Section~\ref{sec:starring}, addresses social-psychological incentives,
recommendation, and voting and ranking. RCloud's integrated deployment
mechanism, described in Section~\ref{sec:deployment}, addresses cost of
integration, content export, presentation and view sharing. Notebooks,
and the integrated version control system for them, described in
Section~\ref{sec:notebooks}, address modularity and granularity, and
artifact histories.

Manyeyes \cite{Viegas:2007:MAS} was a landmark system supporting the
integration of social media with visualization and data publishing.

\cite{Perer:2008:ISA}

Our work has been inspired by and has benefited from other recent projects
to improve data analysis environments and processes, including RStudio,
R packages such as Markdown, knitr and Shiny, and iPython notebooks,
to name a few. RStudio aims at providing an integrated development environment
for R programming, with support for publishing code in packages. Markdown,
knitR and Shiny provide R with sophisticated reporting capabilities, including
interactive web interfaces. IPython \cite{Perez:2007:IAS}
shares many of our goals...

\subsection{Deployment of notebooks\label{sec:deployment}}

Notebooks as versioned subroutines, web services.

Notebooks by default are visible by the entire organization: there
exists a URL for every notebook in RCloud. This is deliberate. As
pointed out by Wattenberg and Kriss~\cite{Wattenberg:2011:DFS}, broad
access to analysis outputs (in their case, in the form of NameVoyager)
increases long-term engagement partly by the crossreferences in the
web. Our main RCloud deployment is only visible inside an intranet,
but we have nevertheless found anecdotal support for this theory by
noticing links to RCloud notebooks in internal discussion fora and
mailing lists.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}

% limitations
Previous studies have pointed out difficulties in achieving production-level
flexibility, scalability and maintainability with experimental code created
by data analysts. These properties cannot be ensured by any programming environment,
but suitable tools can help well-intentioned analysts and programmers to create
robust applications with less effort.

Asynchronous collaborative visual analytics
(ACVA)~\cite{Chen:2011:SEC}. This paper addresses visualization
\emph{of} the ACVA process. It will be important when we talk about
recommendation systems, and navigation of the set of notebooks, etc.
