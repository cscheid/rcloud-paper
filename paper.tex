%% Abstract section.
\abstract{ Consider the emerging role of data science teams within
  organizations. Individual data scientists and statisticians usually
  work on loosely related problems, and must devise effective ways to
  share their findings and move results from exploratory data analysis
  into automated diagnostics and reports deployed for wider consumption.
  There are two problems with the current
  practice. First, there are gaps in this workflow: EDA is performed
  with one set of tools, and automated reports and deployments with another.
  Second, EDA environments often assume a single-developer perspective,
  while data scientist teams would get much benefit from easier sharing
  of scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations, and automated
  recommendations, which are well beyond what traditional version control
  systems provide. We contribute and justify the following three
  requirements for systems built to support current data science teams
  and users: \emph{technology transfer}, \emph{coexistence}, and
  \emph{discoverability}. In addition, we contribute the design and
  implementation of RCloud, a system that supports the requirements
  collaborative data analysis, visualization and web deployment. We
  discuss the design decisions, tradeoffs and limitations, and compare RCloud
  to other current proposals.
  \carlos{RCloud has been in production use for more than a year and has about one hundred active users. We will discuss the adoption issues and etc etc.}
