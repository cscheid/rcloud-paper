I did the interviews in a very informal way, but this is the outline of the questions I asked.

Usually all but the first ended up being short background questions, and then the bulk of the interview focused on what doesn't work or could be improved.

- What kind of work do you do?

- How often do you use RCloud?

- Were you an R programmer before using RCloud?

- What do you use RCloud for?

- What tools do you use for data analysis when you're not using RCloud?

- What are the steps of your work?

- When you are presenting your work, what is the final product? Â What tools do you use to present it?

- Do you use visualization?

- What works well in RCloud?

- What would you like to use RCloud for and you currently cannot?

will not use any names, will not use extended quotes.  want to get a sense of how people do data analysis in a large company.
