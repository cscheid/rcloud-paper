% What's the area
Consider the emerging role of a data science team within an
organization today \cite{Keim:2008:VAS}.

% How do people do it today?
Individual data scientists and statisticians usually work on loosely
related problems, and must devise effective ways to share their findings
and move results from exploratory data analysis to automated diagnostics
and reports that are deployed for wider consumption.
They generally rely on a patchwork of resources shared informally,
or at best, through systems that attack individual tasks or functions
in the data analysis workcycle. % might cite information visualization reference model or pirolli/card

% Why does this not work?
There are two problems with the current
practice. First, there are gaps in the workflow:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done with one set of tools,
and automated reports and deployments with another. This makes
transferring results between EDA and production (in both directions)
slow, expensive, and error-prone. Coordination is done through
meetings and may take months to implement.

Second, EDA environments often assume a single-developer perspective,
while data scientist teams could greatly benefit from convenient searching
and sharing of scripts, data sets, data feeds, experiments, annotations,
and automated analyses and recommendations. These capabilities have had
tremendous impact on information retrieval in general but are well
beyond what existing visual analytics environments provide, or what
is found in today's repositories and version control systems.

% What are we going to do about this?
\todo{Sell idea, not system} In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis
that the practice of visual analytics can advance by adopting techniques
from information retrieval and collaborative work environments. To investigate
these ideas, we designed and deployed a prototype environment called RCloud,
that supports collaborative data analysis, visualization and web deployment.
We will report on the design decisions, tradeoffs and limitations, and compare
the concepts in RCloud to similar proposals.

\todo{Define the requirements for the system}

We begin by noting the main requirements for a data analysis environment for
collaboration and transfer of results into production.

Main requirement is to satisfy these two sets of users: R coders and
managers. They work differently and want different things. What should
the infrastructure look like so they both coexist in peace? If this is
such a fundamental problem, why have other tools not addressed it?
Discuss Shiny (maybe in the disc. section).

\begin{itemize}
\item Constant technology transfer. Experiments in notebooks developed
by analysts need to become accessible in the production environment,
making it easy to push new features, prototypes, etc.
\item Dashboarding. To support the above, there should be a mode in which non-experts
can operate the experiments without coding.
\item Version control as a primary concept in the repository. There
needs to be a way to control the visibility of prototypes as they are
being developed and tested.
\item Coexistence in the current data ecosystem. We perceive the
isolation of current exploratory visualization and data analysis
environments to be a serious threat to a wider adoption of modern
techniques.
\item Modern interactive technologies. current isolation
notwithstanding, we find there is business demand for interactive
visualization tools. The main challenge here is how to integrate
these technologies so data scientists and statisticians can target
them, \emph{and} business-facing users can use them.
%% Scalable technologies like crossfilter exist. Want to support those in the context of an R environment. Need to support full 2-way communication between computing in the cloud and interaction on the web.
%% \item Other requirements e.g. Kandel's user study. Not our contribution but things we must address, mentioned in related work section. Heer/Agrawala design considerations for collaborative visual analytics.
\end{itemize}

% What is the scope of our solution?
Our investigation focuses on the R language \cite{RCoreTeam:2013:R}
for statistical computing and graphics. R is one of the most popular
systems for data analysis and is well-supported by
a complex ecosystem of compatible packages, software
tools and other resources.
%
Of importance to us, there are existing
packages for high performance computing in the cloud,
and for generating web graphics. % no, there aren't. we wrote those!

% We want our solution to play well with the rest of the ecosystem
