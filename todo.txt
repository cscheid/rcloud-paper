Each page should have a figure that explains what is going on.
Screenshots + schematic diagrams. "everything becomes a web service."
Looks like figure 2...

Better examples: vignettes from RStudio or all R Packages.  GGPlot2
http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/vignette.html
Each library has its own entry.

exploratory vis, analysis, deployment are three separate things
have a teaser that talks about these three things

showcasing search
what is the minimum deployment to show these things

have a webpage that looks like browse.html and we just search all the notebooks and sort them by person, sort by thumbnails

search/browse
edit
call/deploy

call things - use the API.  dashboard.  Call.R.

- it is a systems paper with a design component. not a design paper like
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/mizbee/Overview.html
D3 is a nice example http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-D3-InfoVis.pdf

extensible - can operate on anything - workbooks, menus, etc.
e.g. turn your research into slides  like knitr with a GUI

------------------------------------------ --------------------------------
How does it help a data science team?  What activities can take
advantage of RCloud's capabilities?

What is the purpose of notebooks?  Why focus on notebooks?

Need to justify the design decisions.

------------------------------------------ --------------------------------
Need an outstanding example for the first figure.

Text analytics example

Demographics example

Example that illustrates power of collaboration
Example that illustrates the power of search, somehow

De-emphasize technologies, though need to explain what is really important.
Explain why, not what.  (But need to explain how graphics work.)

Feedback from real users is crucial

Need a 2-min video
