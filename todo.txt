Concern about citing software that is not a paper, makes us look
too much like a product.  So isolate to one paragraph: in addition
to this other work, there are other software projects aimed in
this direction.

Point of reference are reproducible documents, literate programming.
Live interactive things that as visual analytics people we care about deeply.

KnitR is a paper too
A live always-on KnitR

Have people tried to connect source and the visualization?

Matrix of systems and features they support.

Ask Jean Daniel Fekete to review - plan for March 15

Make some effort to understand the VAST literature and how to sell it to them.

How to interview users;

books - we need to share results we have, this is what we need
from book that Carlos summarized

a new point in the design space that has not been sufficiently explored

need to explicitly say,that we are aimed at a small number of scientists working in a large organization.
cite conway's result

rcloud Notebooks are being created so they can be called by the right people
a deployment that mimics the communication structure of the organization

when writing a systems paper you need to talk about the community that is using the system

cite the interview book, not shy away from understand what the people are saying

"it is natural that the system will reflect the organization we are supporting. this is conway's law."

need examples - demographics
show web publication
how do you show collaboration?

can you find people on both sides of stuff that was transferred from the stats dept. then demo can be a teaser, somewhat artificial.

not a solution for everyone?  
mailchimps model - each person is an expert in one thing.
but what if somebody leaves?

threats to adoption: employee backlash. making people less necessary.  exposing what they are doing - cuts both ways.

what is the teaser?

An org. of 5 to 50 people are working on a collection of problems that change quickly.
In this org. nobody knows everything.
An environment for programmers, know how to write R.
Trying to bridge the gap between people that know how to write data analysis code
(R, MatLab, numpy) and the people that use it.  How do you make it easier for them
to re-use each others code and make their work instantly usable to other people
in the organization that consumes the things that they produce? Trying to maximize
their productivity. No longer isolated in the company any more. People are asking
them to engage closely with the business side of the company.  Full stack developer.
Modelers wranglers visualizers developers 
Not enough people to do all the system integration, and takes too long.
(Interview paper 6.3 Kandell etc.) A generalist is more valuable than a specialist.
A specialist can't switch levels. We argue that they need a good system that
lets them do that. What the statistis department looks like. 
Have a lot of specific skills and want to be able to re-use their smarts.
Make the human resources of the group more efficient.
RCloud was built to empower the people in the stats department in the way that they operate.

Let's talk about the statistics dept. at AT&T. These people care about making sure the 
network is going well, hundreds of millions of devices, difference software, legacy,
marketing, bla bla bla.  How complicated data problems are at AT&T.
Need to share discoveries and turn them into cost savigns or revenue opportunities.
Want to
We contribute RCloud as one complete proposal.
It is being used by hundreds of people.

Case studies.  How do we finesse this. Someone turned an analysis into a dashboard.
What is R--. RBI. Point and click interface for some kind of analysis.
Kenny's topic modeling stuff. Might be used by 12 people. Made a nice internal application.
Has its own interface, but makes calls through Notebook.R (?) so actually a good example.
Do other organizations work the same way?  Who would go on the record?  Carlos:Etsy?
Stephen:LinkedIn - Dan Tunkelang. Mauricio Resende:Amazon?
Clearinghouse for all interesting work in the department.
Clearinghouse to find each other's work.
Make it a story about the stats department.

Each page should have a figure that explains what is going on.
Screenshots + schematic diagrams. "everything becomes a web service."
Looks like figure 2...

Better examples: vignettes from RStudio or all R Packages.  GGPlot2
http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/vignette.html
Each library has its own entry.

exploratory vis, analysis, deployment are three separate things
have a teaser that talks about these three things

showcasing search
what is the minimum deployment to show these things

have a webpage that looks like browse.html and we just search all the notebooks and sort them by person, sort by thumbnails

search/browse
edit
call/deploy

call things - use the API.  dashboard.  Call.R.

- it is a systems paper with a design component. not a design paper like
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/mizbee/Overview.html
D3 is a nice example http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-D3-InfoVis.pdf

extensible - can operate on anything - workbooks, menus, etc.
e.g. turn your research into slides  like knitr with a GUI

------------------------------------------ --------------------------------
How does it help a data science team?  What activities can take
advantage of RCloud's capabilities?

What is the purpose of notebooks?  Why focus on notebooks?

Need to justify the design decisions.

------------------------------------------ --------------------------------
Need an outstanding example for the first figure.

Text analytics example

Demographics example

Example that illustrates power of collaboration
Example that illustrates the power of search, somehow

De-emphasize technologies, though need to explain what is really important.
Explain why, not what.  (But need to explain how graphics work.)

Feedback from real users is crucial

Need a 2-min video
