Summary review complaints:

  I do not see how the paper can be significantly changed with its current
  structure. But the following presentation issues could be addressed in
  several weeks:  
   1- the beginning of the paper: on the issue, its important, and current
  gap
   2- system: provide more details about the system and some design
  decisions
   3- Evaluation: choice of evaluation, and more details about the
  evaluation, settings, etc (right now it is too scattered and not
  presented in a normal (or clear) format:  objectives, users, setting,  
  process,results, etc. 
   4-discussion: focus around the most important lesson learned.
